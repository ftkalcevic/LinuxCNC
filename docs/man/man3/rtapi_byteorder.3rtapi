.SH NAME

rtapi_byteorder.h \- RTAPI wrappers for linux kernel functionality

.SH SYNTAX
.HP
#include <rtapi_byteorder.h>
.TP
RTAPI_BIG_ENDIAN
Defined to 1 if the platform is big-endian, 0 otherwise
.TP
RTAPI_LITTLE_ENDIAN
Defined to 1 if the platform is little-endian, 0 otherwise
.TP
RTAPI_FLOAT_BIG_ENDIAN
Defined to 1 if the platform double-precision value is big-endian, 0 otherwise.

.SH DESCRIPTION
In kernel space, each rtapi_xxx or RTAPI_XXX identifier is mapped to the
underlying kernel functionality, if available.

In userspace, or in kernels where the underlying functionality is not provided
by a kernel, generally another implementation--possibly with reduced
functionality--is provided.  (For example, the userspace implementation for
rtapi_byteorder_register always succeeds)

.SH REALTIME CONSIDERATIONS
May be used at any time.

.SH RETURN VALUE
As in Linux.
