== License

PlasmaC and all its related software is released under GPLv2.

== Introduction

PlasmaC is a LinuxCNC configuration for plasma cutting incorporating the PlasmaC HAL component with GUI configurations for both <<cha:axis-gui, Axis>> and <<cha:gmoccapy,Gmoccapy>>. It should run on any hardware that is supported on LinuxCNC provide there are enough I/O pins.

If you are new user, it may be worthwhile having a read through the <<cha:plasma-primer, Plasma CNC Primer>> document which is a generic introduction to CNC plasma cutting.

PlasmaC uses one of three different operating modes.

[width="100%",cols="4,16"]
|===
|*Mode*|*Description*
|0|Use external arc voltage in to calculate Arc Voltage and Arc OK
|1|Use external arc voltage in to calculate Arc Voltage +
   Use external arc ok in for Arc OK
|2|Use external arc ok in for Arc OK +
   Use external up/down for THC
|===

For full functionality, Plasmac requires LinuxCNC v2.9 (the current master) or later. It will work on LinuxCNC v2.8 with only the <<paused-motion, paused motion>> feature not available.

No Z axis motion is required in G-Code, the standard PlasmaC configurations will comment out any Z commands during program load.

For reliable use of PlasmaC you should *NOT* use any Z axis offsets other than coordinate system offsets (G54 -G59.3).

Normally it is best to touch off your Z axis to roughly the top of your stock then bring the Z axis to almost the top of travel before starting your cuts.

== I/O Requirements

This section only touches on the I/O required for PlasmaC itself, base machine requirements such as limit switches, home switches etc. are in addition to these.

[width="100%",cols="4,2,14"]
|===
|*Name*|*Modes*|*Description*
|Arc Voltage|0,1|Analog input to read the arc voltage +
                 Typically connected to a velocity output from an encoder
|Float Switch|0,1,2|Digital input. Optional, see below +
                    Connected to the switch on the floating head +
                    If not using an ohmic probe this is the primary probe sensor +
                    If using an ohmic probe this is the fallback probe sensor
|Ohmic Probe|0,1,2|Digital input. Optional, see below +
                   Connected to the probe output +
                   If used, this is the primary probe sensor
|Ohmic Probe Enable|0,1,2|Digital output. Only required if using ohmic probing +
                          Connected to the probe enabling input +
                          This pin is used to arm the ohmic probe
|Breakaway Switch|0,1,2|Digital input. Optional, see below +
                        Connected to the torch breakaway switch +
                  Senses if the torch has broken away from its cradle
|Torch On|0,1,2|Digital output +
                Connected to the torch on input of the plasma power supply
|Move Up|2|Digital input +
           Connected to the up output of the external THC control
|Move Down|2|Digital input +
             Connected to the down output of the external THC control
|Scribe Arming|0,1,2|Digital output +
                     Connected to scribe arming circuit
|Scribe On|0,1,2|Digital output +
                     Connected to scribe on circuit
|===

Only one of either 'float switch' or 'ohmic probe' is required. If both are used then 'float switch' will be a fallback if 'ohmic probe' is not sensed.

If 'ohmic probe' is used then 'ohmic probe enable' is required.

'breakaway switch' is not mandatory because 'float switch' is treated the same as a breakaway when not probing. If they were two separate switches, the could be combined and connected as a 'float switch'

NOTE: The minimum I/O requirement for a PlasmaC configuration is 'arc voltage' input, 'float switch' input and 'torch on' output. In this case, PlasmaC treats the float switch as a breakaway switch when it is not probing.

IMPORTANT: These pins will be entered later into the Configurator, they should *NOT* be used in your base machine .hal file.

== Installation

=== Getting LinuxCNC With The PlasmaC Add-Ons

The minimum requirement for PlasmaC is LinuxCNC v2.8, although this version does NOT support the <<paused-motion, paused motion>> feature.

LinuxCNC v2.9 or later provides full functionality and is the recommended option.

=== If You Do Not Have Linux Installed

Download an ISO image from one of the following and write it to a bootable device:

* RTPREEMPT - http://www.linuxcnc.org/testing-stretch-rtpreempt/ +
For a machine using Mesa Electronics hardware, this can also be used for a machine using a parallel port and is recommended for most modern machines.

* RTAI - http://www.linuxcnc.org/iso/linuxcnc-2.7.14-wheezy.iso +
For a machine using the parallel port.

Then boot from the device and follow the prompts.

This will give you a machine with the current stable (v2.7) branch of LinuxCNC, go to the next section and follow the type of installation you would like. The 'Buildbot' is recommended for most users that will not be doing any LinuxCNC development.

NOTE: It is possible to install and run LinuxCNC on a variety of Linux distributions but this is beyond the scope of the Plasmac User Guide. If you wish to follow this path then you will need to install your preferred Linux distribution and then install LinuxCNC v2.9 or later (or LinuxCNC v2.8 if you don't need reverse-run) then you can open LinuxCNC and continue with <<sec:testing-linuxcnc, Testing LinuxCNC Installation>>

All PlasmaC development has been done on a Stretch ISO installation.

=== If You Have LinuxCNC v2.7

You can then choose between:

* <<buildbot-install, A Buildbot installation>> The LinuxCNC Buildbot provides pre-compiled packages which can be installed by a package manager.
* <<rip-install, A Run In Place installation>>. RIP builds are compiled on your computer and are normally used if you wish to do any development work.

[[buildbot-install]]

==== Buildbot Installation

For more information on the LinuxCN Buildbot, see the http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/[LinuxCNC buildbot]

To use the buildbot packages on your computer, first add the buildbot archive signing key to your apt keychain by running this command from a terminal:

----
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-key E0EE663E
----

If you get an error downloading the key it may be caused by being behind a firewall or a proxy server. In this case it may be worthwhile specifying port 80 rather than using the default of 11371:

----
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net:80 --recv-key E0EE663E
----

Close the terminal, then from the Main Menu, open Synaptic Package Manager.

Select Search in the menu bar and do a search using 'linuxcnc' as the search term. Right click on any linuxcnc results and then click Mark for Removal. When all installed results are selected click Apply on the menu bar and these will be deleted.

Click Settings from the menu and select Repositories.

You can then either edit or delete existing LinuxCNC entries from the repositories list. You need to end up with the following set of stanzas as the only references to LinuxCNC:

----
deb     http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/ <distro> <branch>-<rt_type>
deb-src http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/ <distro> <branch>-<rt_type>
----

Where:

* <distro> is stretch or wheezy
* <branch> is master or 2.8
* <rt_type> is rtpreempt or rt

So if you installed the 'stretch' version and wanted master branch then you would have:

----
deb     http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/ stretch master-rtpreempt
deb-src http://buildbot.linuxcnc.org/ stretch master-rtpreempt
----

When this is completed Synaptic should do a package reload, if not do a manual Reload from the menu bar.

Now do a Search with 'linuxcnc' as the search term and the result should be a list of newly available LinuxCNC packages

Right click on the package you want to install and then select Mark for Installation.

For rtpreempt you would select linuxcnc-uspace and for rt it would be linuxcnc.

You may also select the documentation if you want it installed locally and/or the -dev package if you intend to build new realtime components and/or alternate front-ends for linuxcnc.

When you have made all your selections, click Apply on the menu bar and the selected packages will be installed.

Go to <<sec:testing-linuxcnc, testing the linuxCNC installation>>

[[rip-install]]

==== Run In Place Installation

For more information on a Run In Place installation, see http://linuxcnc.org/docs/master/html/code/building-linuxcnc.html[Building LinuxCNC]

CAUTION: Ensure you are *NOT* the root user +
Do *NOT* use sudo except for the 'make setuid' step

Open a terminal window:

----
$ git clone git://github.com/linuxcnc/linuxcnc.git linuxcnc-dev
$ cd linuxcnc-dev/src
$ ./autogen.sh
----

for RTPREEMPT

----
$ ./configure --with-realtime=uspace
----

For RTAI (mostly for parallel port machines)

----
$ ./configure --with-realtime=/usr/realtime-$VERSION
----

You can then try to compile LinuxCNC.

----
$ make
----

If you get errors here have a look at http://linuxcnc.org/docs/devel/html/code/building-linuxcnc.html#Satisfying-Build-Dependencies[Satisfying Build Dependencies]

If no errors:

----
$ sudo make setuid
$ . ../scripts/rip-environment (that is dot space dot dot slash)
$ linuxcnc
----

My preferred method of opening a run in place version of LinuxCNC is:

----
$ ~/linuxcnc-dev/scripts/linuxcnc
----

This script will set the required environment variables and start linuxcnc.

You could then point this to an .ini file and open a configuration. This command could then be put in a desktop shortcut.

----
$ ~/linuxcnc-dev/scripts/linuxcnc ~/linuxcnc/configs/plasmac/plasmac.ini
----

[[sec:testing-linuxcnc]]

=== Testing LinuxCNC Installation

The LinuxCNC Configuration Selector should open.

Navigate to Sample Configurations - by_machine - plasmac.

Select either Axis or Gmoccapy.

Select either metric or imperial.

You now have all the requirements to run PlasmaC, the next step is to create a working configuration for your machine.

=== Make A Working Base Machine Configuration

IMPORTANT: Base machine configuration means a complete working system without the Plasmac configuration. All axes should be working and tuned for best performance and all home and limit switches if installed should be operating correctly.

Do NOT add any plasma specific connections here, these will be added later.

[[z_settings]]

Recommended settings for the Z axis are:

* Z MINIMUM_LIMIT should be just below top of slats with allowances for float_switch_travel and table_discrepencies.
* Z MAXIMUM_LIMIT should be the highest you want the Z axis to travel (must not be lower than Z HOME_OFFSET)
* Z HOME should be just below the maximum limit

IMPORTANT: You should be able to home your machine, touch off, jog to soft limits without crashing and run some test G-Code without any errors.

When this stage is completed you can configure PlasmaC on top of your working machine.

You can create a base machine manually or you may use existing configuration helpers:

NOTE: It is probably best to keep the base machine config simple until you have it fully tested and tuned. If you are using stepconf or pncconf then deselect the VCP Panel, manual tool change and classic ladder options these can be manually added later if you have a need for them.

If using a Mesa Electronics board, use the <<cha:pncconf-wizard, pncconf wizard>>:

----
$ pncconf
----

If using a parallel port, use the <<cha:stepconf-wizard, stepconf wizard>>:

----
$ stepconf
----

If using a Pico Systems board: +
https://forum.linuxcnc.org/27-driver-boards/14977-pico-systems-faq[This LinuxCNC forum thread] may help.

If you have a dual motor gantry configuration you may need to hand edit your configuration to suit: +
https://forum.linuxcnc.org/49-basic-configuration/33079-how-to-2-or-more-motors-on-one-axis-gantry-linuxcnc-2-8-master?start=0[This LinuxCNC forum thread] may help.

=== Add PlasmaC To Base Machine

You need to have a fully tested and working base machine configuration without any connections to plasma specific equipment before proceeding.

CAUTION: Do *NOT* proceed until this has been done

If you are using a Mesa Electronics THCAD card for arc voltage measurement, see <<mesa-thcad, Mesa THCAD>> before proceeding

[[configurator]]

Installing a Plasmac configuration is done from the Configurator, the type of installation determines the location of the Configurator (configurator.py):

=== Start A Plasmac BuildBot Installation

From a terminal:

====
$ python /usr/share/doc/linuxcnc/examples/sample-configs/by_machine/plasmac/configurator.py
====

=== Start A PlasmaC Run In Place Installation

From a terminal:

====
$ python ~/linuxcnc-dev/configs/by_machine/plasmac/configurator.py
====

TIP: If the Configurator does not run make sure that the file permissions allow executable.

=== Install

The selection window is now visible:

image::images/plasmac_configurator_home_new.png[width=300]

Select 'New' from the selection window, this shows an info dialog, select 'Continue' and the New Configuration window will display.

NOTE: There will be different fields visible depending on the mode you select.

|===

NOTE: If you are not sure of the full name of a HAL pin then start LinuxCNC for your base machine and run 'HalShow' for a full listing of all HAL pins.

Fill in the required entries to suit your machine wiring, click 'Create' and you should end up with a working PlasmaC configuration in ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine-name>

This can be run as follows:

* For a buildbot installation: +
----
$ linuxcnc ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine-name>.<machine-name>.ini
----

* For a run in place installation: +
----
$ ~/linuxcnc-dev/scripts/linuxcnc ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine-name>.<machine-name>.ini
----

After creating a new configuration some initial setup is required.

=== Initial Setup

LinuxCNC should now be running with the PlasmaC panels visible.
Open the Config Panel and ensure every one of these settings suits your machine.

See <<config-panel, Config Panel>>

IMPORTANT: If using a Mesa THCAD then up until now the 'Voltage Scale' value was obtained mathematically. If you intend to use cut voltages from manufactures cut charts then it would be advisable to do measurements of actual voltages and fine tune the 'Voltage Scale' and 'Voltage Offset'.

CAUTION: Plasma cutting voltages can be lethal, if you are not experienced in doing these measurements get some qualified help.

[[lowpass]]

=== Lowpass Filter

The PlasmaC HAL component has an inbuilt lowpass filter which has the same behaviour as the LinuxCNC lowpass HAL component. This filter if used is applied to the 'plasmac.arc-voltage output'. The pin name to use for this filter is 'plasmac.lowpass-frequency' and as the name suggests you enter the cutoff frequency that is required, if the frequency is zero then there is no filtering applied.

It is suggested that if you wish to use the filter then the entry for it should be in the <machine_name>_connections.hal file in your configuration directory.

----
setp plasmac.lowpass-frequency 100
----

Would give a cutoff frequency of 100Hz.

=== Contact Debounce

Contact bounce or external interference may cause some inconsistent behaviour of the following switches:

* Float Switch
* Ohmic Probe
* Breakaway Switch

This may be alleviated by changing the debounce value in the <MACHINE>_connections.hal file. This value applies to all three switches simultaneously in a standard configuration.

You could separate these by using an exclusive debounce component for each switch.

Each increment changes the debounce timing by one servo thread cycle and for the Float and Ohmic switches it equates to a 0.001mm (0.00004") increase in the probed height result.

== Desktop Launcher

You could create a desktop launcher to your config by right clicking on the desktop and selecting Create Launcher or similar. This will bring up a dialog to create a launcher. Give it a nice short name, enter anything for the command and click OK.

After the launcher appears on the desktop, right click on it and then open with your editor of choice. Edit the file so it looks similar to:

----
[Desktop Entry]
Comment=
Terminal=false
Name=LinuxCNC
Exec=sh -c "linuxcnc $HOME/linuxcnc/configs/<machine>/<machine>.ini"
Type=Application
Icon=/usr/share/pixmaps/linuxcncicon.png
----

The above Exec line would suit a Buildbot installation. For a Run In Place Installation it should be:

----
Exec=sh -c "$HOME/linuxcnc-dev/scripts/linuxcnc $HOME/linuxcnc/configs/<machine>/<machine>.ini"
----

If you would like a terminal window to open behind the GUI window then change the Terminal line to:

----
Terminal=true
----

Displaying a terminal is be handy for error messages and information messages.
 
== Plasmac Files

After an installation, the following files are created in the configuration directory:
[width="100%",cols="1,2"]
|===
|*Filename*|*Function*
|<MACHINE>.ini|configuration file
|<MACHINE>.hal|HAL connections for the PlasmaC component
|<MACHINE>_connections.hal|HAL connections to the I/O HAL pins
|postgui.hal|a HAL file run after the GUI has loaded for user customizing
|===

NOTE: Custom commands are allowed in <MACHINE>_connections.hal and the postgui.hal files as they are not overwritten during upgrades

In addition to the above files, the following links are created to the files in the source directory:
[width="100%",cols="1,2"]
|===
|*Filename*|*Function*

|plasmac_stats.var|saved statistics
|===

NOTE: The .ini files are notated for extra the requirements for these configurations.

NOTE: The .cfg files are plain text and may be edited with any text editor.


== PlasmaC GUI Panels

PlasmaC adds several panels to the GUI, some are panels on permanent display and others are tabs behind the preview tab.

Some functions are only used for particular modes and are not displayed if not required.

[[config-panel]]

=== Config Panel
This panel is for configuration parameters that are modified infrequently.

It is possible to disable this panel so machine settings cannot be modified by unauthorised personnel. This is achieved by setting a variable in the .ini file:

----
[PLASMAC] CONFIG_DISABLE = 1
----

A HAL pin named 'plasmac_config.config-disable' can then be set to Zero to enable the panel. This pin could be tied to a key-switch or similar so only authorised personnel could enable the Config Panel.

[[run-buttons]]

[underline]*Save Button*

The *'Save'* button has two modes of operation:

. If the Default material is displayed then all the currently displayed parameters on the Run Panel will be saved as the default.
. If any other material is showing then the displayed Cut Parameters will be saved for that material, all other materials remain unchanged.

[underline]*Reload Button*

The *'Reload'* button will reload the default material and the material file.

[underline]*New Button*

The *'New'* button allows the addition of a new material in the material file.

It will prompt for a material number and a material name. When these are entered it will create the new material using the Cut Parameters from the Default Material and then reload the material file with the new material displayed.

Make any required changes and then save them using the save button.

[underline]*Delete Button*

The *'Delete'* button allows the deletion of a material from the material file.

It will prompt for a material number and when this is entered it will prompt again to make sure you want to delete it.

If the deletion is confirmed it will delete the material from the material file and reload the materials with the default material loaded.

=== Monitor Panel

The Monitor Panel is used for display only, both Axis and Gmoccapy have similar Monitor Panels.

|THC Void Lock|0,1|Indicates THC is locked due to void being sensed
|===

NOTE: The Ohmic Probe LED will show the status of the probe input regardless of whether Ohmic Probe is enabled or disabled.


=== Button Panel

The Button Panel contains buttons useful for the operation of the machine.

Both GUIs have a 'Torch Enable' button which is permanent, all other buttons are <<custom-user-buttons, user programmable>> in the .ini file. Axis has five user buttons and Gmoccapy has four user buttons.

Axis button layout:

image::images/plasmac_buttons_a.png[width=400]

Gmoccapy button layout:

image::images/plasmac_buttons_g.png[width=100]

The 'Torch Enable' button toggles between Enabled and Disabled.

It needs to be Enable to do any cutting.

If it is Disabled then running a loaded program will cause the program to do its cycle without the torch being activated.

=== Control Panel

The Control Panel allows the control of some functions, both GUI's are similar except that the Gmoccapy Control Panel is integrated into the frame containing feed and rapid overrides.

These functions are enabled and disable automatically depending on the status of the machine.

Axis Control Panel: 

image::images/plasmac_control_a.png[width=300]

Gmoccapy Control Panel:

image::images/plasmac_control_g.png[width=300]

[underline]*Torch Pulse*

This pulses the torch on for the amount of time set in the corresponding slider.

[[paused-motion]]

[underline]*Paused Motion*

When a program is paused, this allows x/y motion to follow the programmed path in the reverse or forward direction at the percentage of the current feed rate shown in the adjustment.

When reversing, motion will stop when it reaches a spindle on command.

When forwarding, motion can continue until the end of the path.

NOTE: Paused motion is only available in LinuxCNC version 2.9 or later.

[underline]*Height Change*

Each press of Raise or Lower will change the height of the torch by the value set in Height Per Volt in the Arc frame of the Config Panel. Reset will cancel any height override.

=== Statistics Panel

This provides statistics to allow tracking of consumable wear and job times.

They are shown for the current job and are also as a running total.

Job statistics are reset when the current program is run.

The total values may be reset either individually or all together.

image::images/plasmac_stats.png[width=400]

=== Extras Panel

This provides a shapes library with some simple shapes that can be selected and loaded into LinuxCNC.

It also provides ten custom user buttons which operate the same as the other custom user buttons plus they have the ability to load a GCode program and have an image displayed on the button.

See <<shape-library, shape library>> for shape usage.
 
See <<custom-user-buttons, custom user buttons>> for button usage.

image::images/plasmac_extras.png[width=400]

The Extras panel may be disabled by commenting out the appropriate entries in the [DISPLAY] section of the .ini file. This will have no effect on the operation of the PlasmaC configuration.

== Using PlasmaC

The only mandatory G-Code requirement for a PlasmaC configuration is 'M3 $0 S1' to begin a cut and 'M5' to end a cut, plus of course standard motion codes to move from start to end.

If you are using PlasmaC without <<multi-tool, multiple tools>> enabled then it is permissible to use 'M3 S1' in lieu of 'M3 $0 S1' to begin a cutting job.

=== Coordinates

See <<z_settings, recommended Z axis>> settings.

Each time LinuxCNC is started it requires homing. This allows LinuxCNC to know where in the world the torch is and sets the soft limits to the values specified in the .ini file thus preventing the machine from crashing into a hard stop during normal use.

If your machine does not have home switches then you need to ensure that all axes are at the home coordinates specified in the .ini file before homing.

If your machine has home switches then it will move to the specified home coordinates when directed.

Depending on your configuration you may have a 'Home All' button or you may need to home each axis individually. Use the appropriate button/buttons to home the machine.

After homing the torch needs to know where the material is, this is achieved with 'Touch Off'.

It is recommended that the first time you use PlasmaC that you jog the Z axis down to near the slats and 'Touch Off' the Z axis with a zero offset. When done, jog the Z axis up to where it was originally. This should not need to be done again. From now on leave the Z axis at this position as PlasmaC will control all Z axis motion.

If you intend to place your material in the same place on the table every time then you could jog the X and Y axes to the X0,Y0 position of the material and then 'Touch Off' both axes with a zero offset.

If you intend to place the material randomly on the table then before each job you will need to 'Touch Off' as above or place the material at the previous location.

[[path-tolerance]]

=== Path Tolerance

The provided <<rs274, RS274NGC_STARTUP_CODE>> files, metric_startup.ngc and imperial_startup.ngc set the path tolerance to 0.1mm (0.004") with a G64 command. If LinuxCNC sees an Estop at any stage then the path tolerance if set to default which will round corners off so it is recommended that the path tolerance is set in the header of each GCode file.

[[multi-tool]]

=== Pause At End Of Cut

This causes all motion to pause at the end of the cut with the torch still on. After the specified dwell time has passed the torch will turn off and the Z axis will rise.

The time value for this feature is 'Pause At End' in the Cut Parameters of the Run Panel. This value is also in the material file and may be set for each material.

This feature is used to allow the arc to catch up to the torch position to fully finish the cut. It is usually required for thicker materials, especially stainless.

=== Multiple Tools

Multiple tools allows the use of more than one tool, valid tools are:

* Plasma Torch - for normal cutting
* Scribe - for engraving
* Plasma Torch - for spotting

If multiple tools are enabled then a LinuxCNC tool number is required in the 'M3 command to selected the required tool.

* 'M3 $0 S1' will select the plasma cutting tool.
* 'M3 $1 S1' will select the scribe.
* 'M3 $2 S1' will select the plasma spotting tool.

To enable the multiple tools feature you need to edit the following line in <MACHINE_NAME>_connections.hal.

from:

-----
setp plasmac.multi-tool 0
-----

to:

-----
setp plasmac.multi-tool 1
-----

PlasmaC will read the cut parameters from the Run Panel and use them where required.

[[material-handling]]

=== Material Handling

Material handling has nothing at all to do with the LinuxCNC tool table, instead it uses a material file that was created at the same time as the configuration.

The LinuxCNC tool table and tool commands only come into play if your are using an <<scribe, scribe>> in addition to the plasma torch.

There is a <<material-file, material file>> with its name derived from '[EMC]MACHINE' in the in file, so a machine named 'METRIC_PLASMAC' would have a material file named 'metric_plasmac_material.cfg'.

It is not a requirement that you use a material file, if required you can change the cut parameters manually in the Run Panel. It is also not a requirement to use the automatic material changes, just omit them from the G-Code file.

The following codes may be used for a PlasmaC configuration:

* 'M190 Pn' - changes the material to number n.
* 'M66 P3 L3 Q1' - waits for material change to be confirmed.
* 'F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]>' - sets the feed rate to the feed rate shown in the cut parameters of the Run Panel.
* 'M3 $0 S1' - starts the PlasmaC component.

For manual material handling you manually select the material from the materials list in the Run Panel before running your GCode which should have the following minimum code:

----
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]>
M3 $0 S1
...
M5
----

NOTE: Manual material handling does restrict you to only one material for the entire job.

For automatic material handling, the codes MUST be in the order shown.
You could have other codes between them.
In your G-Code you need:

----
M190 Pn
M66 P3 L3 Q1
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]>
M3 $0 S1
...
M5
----

Material numbers do not need to be consecutive nor do they need to be in numerical order.

When a material is changed it only changes the cut parameters in the Run Panel, LinuxCNC knows nothing of the material nor does PlasmaC know anything about LinuxCNC tools. (i.e. it does NOT do a tool change)

Materials can be selected manually with the either the Cut Parameters combobox or via MDI with M190 Pn.

If a GCode program is loaded which contains one or more material change commands then the first material will be displayed in the Run Panel as the program is loading.

=== THC

NOTE: All references to CutFeedRate mean Cut Feed Rate as displayed in the Run Panel.

THC can be controlled from the THC frame of the Run Panel, off = disabled, on = enabled and auto means abide by the THC Enable checkbox in the cut parameters.

THC can also be enabled or disabled directly from G-Code provided that THC is not disabled in the Run Panel.

PlasmaC uses a control voltage dependent on the state of the Use Auto Volts checkbox in the Run Panel:

. If Use Auto Volts is checked then the actual cut voltage is sampled after the cut begins and this is then used as the control voltage. To allow the arc voltage to stabilise, PlasmaC waits for the amount of time displayed as Delay in the THC frame of the Run Panel before taking the sample.
. If Use Auto Volts is not checked then the voltage displayed as Cut Volts in the Cut Parameters frame of the Run Panel is used as the control voltage.

THC does not become active until the velocity reaches 99.9% of the 'CutFeedRate'.

[underline]*G-Code THC*

THC may be disabled and enabled directly from G-Code provided THC is not disabled in the Run Panel, by setting or resetting the 'motion.digital-out-02' pin with the M-Codes M62-M65:

* 'M62 P2' will disable THC (synchronised with motion)
* 'M63 P2' will enable THC (synchronised with motion)
* 'M64 P2' will disable THC (immediately)
* 'M65 P2' will enable THC (immediately)

[[velocity_thc]]

[underline]*Velocity Based THC*

If the cut velocity falls below a percentage of 'CutFeedRate' then THC will be locked until the cut velocity returns to at least 99% of 'CutFeedRate'.

This percentage is displayed as VAD Threshold % in the THC frame of the Config Panel.

Velocity based THC prevents the torch height being changed when velocity is reduced for a sharp corner or a small hole.

There is a HAL pin available named 'motion.analog-out-03' that can be changed in G-Code with the M67/M68 commands. This pin will reduce the velocity to the percentage specified in the command.

* 'M67 E3 Q0' would set the velocity to 100% of 'CutFeedRate'.
* 'M67 E3 Q40' would set the velocity to 40% of 'CutFeedRate'.
* 'M67 E3 Q60' would set the velocity to 60% of 'CutFeedRate'.
* 'M67 E3 Q100' would set the velocity to 100% of 'CutFeedRate'.

The minimum percentage allowed is 10%, values below this will be set to 100%.

The maximum percentage allowed is 100%, values above this will be set to 100%.

If you intend to use this feature it would be prudent to add 'M68 E3 Q0' to your G-Code preamble and postamble so you start and end at a known state.

TIP: Another way of achieving the same result is to use 'F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]' with a multiplier.

----
F[#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate] * 0.6]
----

WARNING: If Cut Feed Rate in the Run Panel is set to Zero then PlasmaC will use 'motion.requested-velocity' for the THC calculations which is not a very reliable way of velocity based THC and is not recommended.

=== Cutter Compensation

To use cutter compensation you will need to use G41.1, G42.1 and G40 with the kerf width HAL pin:

* 'G41.1 D#<_hal[plasmac_run.kerf-width-f]>' ; for left of programmed path
* 'G42.1 D#<_hal[plasmac_run.kerf-width-f]>' for right of programmed path
* 'G40' to turn compensation off

[[ihs-skip]]

=== IHS Skip

IHS may be skipped in one of two different ways:

If THC is disabled then skip IHS if start of cut less than 'plasmac.skip-ihs-distance' from last successful probe.

If THC is enabled then skip IHS if start of cut less than 'plasmac.skip-ihs-distance' from end of last cut.

=== Probing

Probing may be with either ohmic sensing or a float switch, it is also possible to combine both with the float switch providing a fallback to ohmic probing.

If your torch doesn't support ohmic probing you could have a separate probe next to the torch. In this case you would extend the probe below the torch. The probe must NOT extend more than your minimum Cut Height below the torch and this offset distance is entered as the 'ohmic-probe-offset' in the Config Panel.

Probing setup is done in the Motion frame of the Config Panel.

WARNING: Probe Height is the height above the minimum Z axis limit.

[[cut-types]]

=== Cut Types

PlasmaC allows two different cut types:

* Pierce and Cut - runs the loaded GCode program to pierce then cut.
* Pierce Only - converts then runs the loaded GCode program to do piercing only.

Pierce Only mode is useful for thick materials which may produce enough dross on the material surface from piercing to interfere with the torch while cutting. This enables the entire sheet to be pierced and cleaned off before cutting.

This also enables near end of life consumables to be used for piercing and they can be swapped out for good consumables to be used in cutting.

There are two ways of enabling this feature:

* Program a <<button-cut, custom user button>> to toggle between the cut types.
* Adding a line '<pierce-only> = 1' anywhere in a gcode file to enable Pierce Only mode for the current file.

If using a custom user button then the GUI will automatically reload the file when the cut type is toggled.

=== Hole Cutting - Intro

It is recommended that any holes to be cut have a diameter no less than one and a half times the thickness of the material to be cut.

It is also recommended that holes with a diameter of less than 32mm (1.26") are cut at 60% of the feed rate used for profile cuts. This should also lock out THC due to velocity constraints.

PlasmaC can utilise GCode commands usually set by a CAM Post Processor (PP) to aid in hole cutting or if you don't have a PP or your PP doesn't support these methods then PlasmaC can automatically adapt the GCode to suit. This automatic mode is disabled by default.

There are three methods available for improving the quality of small holes.

. Velocity Reduction: Reduce the velocity to approximately 60% of the 'CutFeedRate'.
. Arc Dwell: Keep the torch on for a short time while all motion is stopped to allow the arc to catch up.
. Overcut: Turn the torch off at the end of the hole then continue along the path of the hole for about 4mm (0.015").

NOTE: If both 'Arc Dwell' and 'Overcut' are active at the same time then 'Overcut' will take precedence.


=== Hole Cutting - GCode Commands

Your GCode commands are set up either by a CAM Post Processor (PP) or by hand coding.

[underline]*Velocity Reduction*

If a hole requires a reduced velocity then set the velocity with 'M67 E3 Q60' which would set the velocity to 60% of 'CutFeedRate'.

See the <<velocity_thc,Velocity Based THC>> section.

[underline]*Arc Dwell*

Hold motion for a time by setting the 'Off Delay' in the Arc frame of the <<config-panel, Config Panel>>

[underline]*Overcut*

The torch can be turned off at the end of the hole by setting the 'motion.digital-out-03' pin with the M-Codes 'M62' or 'M64'. After turning the torch off it is necessary to allow the torch to be turned on again by resetting the 'motion.digital-out-03' pin with the M-Codes 'M63' or 'M65', this will be done automatically by the PlasmaC GCode parser if it reaches an M5 command without seeing a 'M63 P3' or 'M65 P3'.

After the torch is turned of the hole path should be followed for approximately 4mm (0.15")

* 'M62 P3' will turn the torch off (synchronised with motion)
* 'M63 P3' will allow the torch to be turned on (synchronised with motion)
* 'M64 P3' will turn the torch off (immediately)
* 'M65 P3' will allow the torch to be turned on (immediately)

Sample code:

----
G21 (metric)
G64 P0.005
M52 P1 (allow paused motion)
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]> (feed rate from cut parameters)
G0 X10 Y10
M3 $0 S1 (start cut)
G1 X0
M67 E3 Q60 (reduce feed rate to 60%)
G3 I10 (the hole)
M62 P3 (turn torch off)
G3 X0.8 Y6.081 I10 (continue motion for 4mm)
M63 P3 (allow torch to be turned on)
M67 E3 Q0 (restore feed rate to 100%)
M5 (end cut)
G0 X0 Y0
M2 (end job)
----

=== Hole Cutting - Automatic

PlasmaC has the ability to automatically modify the GCode to reduce the velocity and/or apply 'Overcut'.

The default hole size for PlasmaC hole sensing is 32mm (1.26").  It is possible to change this value with the following commands:

* #<m_diameter> = nn - To set a diameter in metric measurments
* #<i_diameter> = nn - To set a diameter in imperial measurements

PlasmaC hole sensing is enabled/disabled by setting the following GCode parameter. It is disabled by default.

* #<holes> = 0 - Disables hole sensing.
* #<holes> = 1 - Causes PlasmaC to reduce the speed of holes less than 32mm (1.25") to 60% of 'CutFeedRate'.
* #<holes> = 2 - As well as the velocity reduction above it also turns the torch off at the end of the hole and follows the hole path for a further 4mm (0.015").

[underline]*Arc Dwell*

Hold motion for a time by setting the 'Off Delay' in the Arc frame of the <<config-panel, Config Panel>>

Use #<holes> = 1 to allow velocity reduction.

Sample code:

----
G21 (metric)
G64 P0.005
M52 P1 (allow paused motion)
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]> (feed rate from cut parameters)
#<holes> = 1 (velocity reduction for holes)
G0 X10 Y10
M3 $0 S1 (start cut)
G1 X0
G3 I10
M5 (end cut)
G0 X0 Y0
M2 (end job)
----

[underline]*Overcut*

Use #<holes> = 2 to allow velocity reduction and overcut.

Sample code:

----
G21 (metric)
G64 P0.005
M52 P1 (allow paused motion)
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]> (feed rate from cut parameters)
#<holes> = 2 (Overcut for holes)
G0 X10 Y10
M3 $0 S1 (start cut)
G1 X0
G3 I10
M5 (end cut)
G0 X0 Y0
M2 (end job)
----

[NOTE]
====
* It is OK to have multiple and mixed #<*_diameter> commands in a GCode file.
* It is OK to have multiple and mixed #<holes> commands in a GCode file.
====

=== Single Cut

A single cut is a single unidirectional cutting move often used to cut a sheet into smaller pieces prior to running a GCode program.

The machine needs to be homed before commencing a single cut.

A single cut will commence from the machines current X/Y position.

[underline]*Automatic Single Cut*

This is the preferred method and the parameters for this method are entered in the Run Panel.

. Jog to the required X/Y start position. +
. Set required Cut Feed Rate in Cut Parameters of the Run Panel. +
. Enter the length of the cut along the X and/or Y axes. +
. Press the 'Start Cut' button and the cut will commence.


[underline]*Pendant Single Cut*

If you have a pendant that can start and stop the spindle plus jog the X and Y axes then you can manually perform a single cut.

. Jog to the required X/Y start position. +
. Set the required feed rate with the Jog Speed slider. +
. Start the procedure by starting the spindle. +
. After probing the torch will fire. +
. When the Arc OK is received the machine can be jogged along the cut line using the jog buttons. +
. When the cut is complete stop the spindle. +
. The torch will turn off and the Z axis returns to the starting position.

[underline]*Manual Single Cut In Axis*

. Jog to the required X/Y start position. +
. Set the required feed rate with the Jog Speed slider. +
. Start the procedure by pressing 'F9'. +
. After probing the torch will fire. +

. When the cut is complete press 'F9' or 'Esc'. +
. The torch will turn off and the Z axis returns to the starting position.

[underline]*Manual Single Cut In Gmoccapy*

If you wish to use the keyboard jogging keys then enable keyboard shortcuts in the Hardware tab of the Settings page, otherwise use the GUI jog buttons.

. Jog to the required X/Y start position. +
. Set the required feed rate with the Jog Speed slider. +
. Enter MDI mode. +
. Start the procedure by entering 'M3 S1'. +
. Enter Manual mode. +
. After probing the torch will fire. +
. When the Arc OK is received the machine can be jogged along the cut line using the jog buttons (or jog keys if enabled). +
. When the cut is complete press 'Esc'. +
. The torch will turn off and the Z axis returns to the starting position.

[[shape-library]]

== Shape Library

The shape library is not meant to be a CAD/CAM replacement and there are limitations as to what can be achieved.

Blank entries in the shape dialogs will use whatever is current. e.g. If 'X start' was blank then the current X axis position would be used.

All lead-ins and lead-outs are arcs except for:

* Small holes
* Stars

The 'New' button in the Extras Panel is only required if you wish to begin a new job and a current job exists.

All distances are in machine units and all angles are in degrees.

=== Settings

Global settings for the shape library can be set by pressing 'Settings' in the Extras Panel. This will bring up the settings dialog to allow the changing and saving of these global settings.

The default parameters available are:

* Preamble
* Postamble
* Lead-in length
* Lead-out length
* Small hole diameter
* Small hole speed

Any internal circle that has a diameter less than 'Small hole diameter' is classed as a small hole. It will have a straight lead-in with a length the lesser of the radius of the hole and the specified lead-in length. It will also have its feed rate set to 'Small hole speed'.

=== Single Shape

. Open the Extras Panel.
. Select the shape you wish to create which will open a shape dialog.
. If using Gmoccapy, open the Preview Panel and move the shape dialog so you can see the Preview Panel. +
  If using Axis the Preview Panel will open automatically when 'Preview' is pressed.
. Enter the appropriate values in the shape dialog and press 'Preview' to load the shape.
. If the shape is not correct, edit the values and press 'Preview' and the new shape will be shown. Repeat until you are satisfied with the shape.

=== Multiple Shapes

Multiple shapes can be added together to create a complex job.

The cut order of the job is determined by the order in which the individual shapes are added to the job.

Once a shape is added to the job it cannot be edited or removed.

Jobs cannot be edited, only added to.

. Create the first shape as in 'Single Shape'.
. Press 'Add' and the shape will be added to the job.
. If you wish to add another version of the same shape then edit the parameters as in #5 above and press 'Add' when you are satisfied with the shape.
. If you wish to add a different shape, press 'Return' in the shape dialog and create a new a new shape as in 'Single Shape'.
. Repeat until you have completed adding all the required shapes. 

=== Array of Shapes

When you are satisfied with the job you have created, an array of the job can be created.

The cut order of an array is from left to right, starting at the bottom row and ending at the top row.

. Press 'Array' in the Extras Panel which will open the array dialog.
. If using Gmoccapy, open the Preview Panel and move the array dialog so you can see the Preview Panel. +
  If using Axis the Preview Panel will open automatically when 'Preview' is pressed.
. Enter the appropriate values in the array dialog and press 'Preview' to load the array.
. If the array is not correct, edit the values and press 'Preview' and the new array will be shown. Repeat until you are satisfied with the shape.
. Press 'Accept' to complete the procedure.

=== Saving A Job

The current job displayed in the Preview Panel may be saved at any time by using the 'Save' feature of the GCode Editor in the GUI.

=== Running A Job

The current job displayed in the Preview Panel may be run at any time.

[[scribe]]

== Scribe

An scribe may be operated by PlasmaC in addition to the plasma torch, this is disabled by default so as not to affect existing configurations.

Using a scribe requires usage of the LinuxCNC tool table, Tool 0 is assigned to the plasma torch and Tool 1 is assigned to the scribe. The scribe X and Y axes offsets from the plasma torch need to be entered into the LinuxCNC tool table. The plasma torch offsets will always be zero. The tools are selected by the 'Tn M6' command then a 'G43 H0' is required to apply the offsets. PlasmaC is then started with a 'M3 $n S1' command. For 'n', use 0 for plasma cutting or 1 for scribing.

There are two HAL output pins used to operate the scribe, one to arm the scribe which moves the scribe to the surface of the material then after a <<scribe-config, delay>> the other to start the scribe, then after a <<scribe-config, delay>> motion will begin.

Using PlasmaC after enabling the scribe then requires selecting either the torch or the scribe in each GCode file as a LinuxCNC tool.

To enable scribing, see <<multi-tool, multiple tools>>.

If you haven't yet assigned the HAL pins for the scribe in the Configurator then you will need to do so by invoking the <<modify-config, reconfigure>> mode of the Configurator.

The scribe is now active and the arming action may be tested by issuing a 'M3 $1 S1' command in the MDI input. This will cause the scribe to arm but will not start the scribe.

The next step is to open the tool table editor in the GUI and enter the X and Y axes offsets. These are the distances in X and Y from the centre of the torch nozzle. In most cases, if standing at the front of the machine if the scribe is to the right of the torch it would be a positive value and if the scribe is to the rear of the torch it would also be a positive value. The offsets for the torch should always be zero.

The final step is to set the <<scribe-config, scribe delays>> required:

. Arm Delay, allows time for the scribe to descend to the surface of the material.
. On Delay, allows time for the scribe to start before motion begins.

Save the Config parameters.

The material can then be lined up with the torch as previously and the offsets can be applied so both tools operate at the correct coordinates.

To use the scribe from GCode:

-----
...
M52 P1 (paused motion on)
F#<_hal[plasmac.cut-feed-rate]>
T1 M6 (select scribe)
G43 H0 (apply ofsets)
M3 $1 S1 (start plasmac with scribe)
...
T0 M6 (select torch)
G43 H0(apply ofsets)
G0 X0 Y0 (parking position)
M5 (end)
-----

It is a good idea to switch back to the torch at the end of the program before your final rapid parking move so your machine is always in the same state at idle.

You can switch between the torch and the scribe any number of times during a program by using the above code and issuing 'M3 $0 S1' to start PlasmaC with the torch.

Issuing M3 S1 (without $n) will cause the machine to behave as if an 'M3 $0 S1' had been issued, so the machine will attempt a torch cut. This is to provide compatibility for previous GCode files.

WARNING: If you have an existing manual toolchange in your machine .hal file then PlasmaC will convert it to an automatic toolchange.

== Spotting

To achieve spotting prior to drilling etc, PlasmaC can pulse the torch for a short duration to mark the drill spot.

This is done by first setting the arc voltage threshold in the <<config-panel, Config Panel>>. If the threshold voltage is set to zero then the delay timer will begin from when the torch on signal was sent. If the threshold voltage is set above zero then the delay timer will begin when the arc voltage reaches the threshold voltage.

Then set the delay time in the <<config-panel, Config Panel>>. When the delay is complete, the torch will turn off. Times are adjustable from 0 to 9999 milli-seconds.

The torch is then turned on in GCode with the 'M3 $2 S1' command which selects the plasma torch as a spotting tool.

To enable spotting, see <<multi-tool, multiple tools>>.

LinuxCNC requires some motion between an 'M3' command and a 'M5' command so a minimal movement at a high speed is programmed.

An example GCode is:

-----
G21 (metric)
F99999 (high feed rate)

g0 x10 y10
m3 $2 s1 (spotting on)
g91 (relative distance mode)
g1 x0.000001
g90 (absolute distance mode)
m5 (spotting off)

g0 x0 y0
g90
m30
-----

NOTE: The 'high feed rate' is to ensure that the motion is at the machines highest feed rate.

IMPORTANT: Some plasma cutters will not be suitable for this feature. +
It is recommended that you carry out some test spotting to ensure that your plasma cutter is capable of utilising this feature.

== Error Messages

There are a number of error messages printed by PlasmaC. They could probably be split into two groups, 'Critical' and 'Warning'.

=== Critical Errors

Critical errors will cause the program to pause, the operator needs to clear the cause of the error.

If the error was during cutting then forward or reverse motion is allowed to enable the machine to be positioned to recommence the cut.

When the error is cleared the program may be resumed.

These errors indicate the corresponding sensor was activated during cutting.

* 'breakaway switch activated program is paused'
* 'float switch activated program is paused'
* 'ohmic probe activated program is paused'
* 'valid arc lost program is paused'

These errors indicate the corresponding sensor was activated before probing commenced.

* 'ohmic probe detected before moving to probe height program is paused'
* 'float switch detected before moving to probe height program is paused'
* 'breakaway switch detected before moving to probe height program is paused'

These errors indicate the corresponding sensor was activated while the Z axis is moving from the top down to the probe height.

WARNING: Probe height is the height above the Z axis minimum limit.

* 'float switch detected while moving to probe height program is paused'
* 'ohmic probe detected while moving to probe height program is paused'

The Z axis reached the bottom limit before the workpiece was detected.

* 'bottom limit reached while probing down program is paused'

The workpiece is too high for any safe rapid removes.

* 'material too high for safe traverse program is paused'

One of these values in Cut Parameters in the Run Panel is invalid.

* 'invalid pierce height or invalid cut height or invalid cut volts'

No arc has been detected after attempting to start the number of times indicated by Arc Start Attempts in the Config Panel.

* 'no arc detected after <n>d start attempts program is paused'

THC has caused the bottom limit to be reached while cutting.

* 'bottom limit reached while THC moving down program is paused'

THC has caused the top limit to be reached while cutting.

* top limit reached while THC moving up program is paused'


=== Warning errors

Warning errors have no effect on a running program and are informational only.

These errors indicate the corresponding sensor was activated before a probe test commenced.

* 'ohmic probe detected before moving to probe height'
* 'float switch detected before moving to probe height'
* 'breakaway switch detected before moving to probe height'

These errors indicate the corresponding sensor was activated while the Z axis is moving from the top down to the probe height during a probe test.

* 'float switch detected while moving to probe height'
* 'ohmic probe detected while moving to probe height'

This indicates that probe contact was lost before probing up to the zero point.

* 'probe trip error while probing'

This indicates the bottom limit was reached during a probe test.

* 'bottom limit reached while probe testing'

This indicates that the safe height has been reduced due to THC raising the Z axis during cutting.

* 'safe traverse height has been reduced'

== INI File

PlasmaC requires some specific .ini file variables as follows:

=== Common

[[custom-user-buttons]]

== Custom User Buttons

There are buttons available that are programmable in the .ini file.

Five buttons are available in the main window of the Axis GUI, numbered 1~5 from left to right.

Four buttons are available in the main window of the Gmoccapy GUI, numbered 1~4 from top to bottom.

An additional ten buttons are available in the Extras panel, numbered 10~19 from top left to bottom right.

All .ini file settings for the buttons are in the [PLASMAC] section.

=== Button Names

The text that appears on the button is set the following way:

----
BUTTON_n_NAME = HAL Show
----

Where n is the button number and 'HAL Show' is the text.

For text on multiple lines in Axis, split the text with a \

----
BUTTON_n_NAME = HAL\Show
----

=== Button Code

Buttons can run <<button-cmds, External Commands>>, <<button-code, G-Code>> or any of four special functions, <<button-probe, Probe Test>>, <<button-ohmic, Ohmic Test>>, <<button-cut, Cut Type>> or <<button-consumables, Change Consumables>>. In addition to this, buttons 10~19 in the Extras panel can <<button-load, Load>> a GCode program.

[[button-cmds]]

[underline]*External Commands*

To run an external command, the command is preceded by a % character.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = %halshow
----

[[button-code]]

[underline]*G-Code*

To run G-Code, just enter the code to be run.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = G0 X100
----

To run an existing subroutine.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = o<my_subroutine> call
----

.ini file variables can be entered by using {} (you must put a space after the })

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = G0 X{JOINT_0 HOME} Y1
BUTTON_n_CODE = G53 G0 Z[{AXIS_Z MAX_LIMIT} - 1.001]
----

Multiple codes can be run by separating the codes with a \

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = G0 X0 Y0 \ G1 X5 \ G1 Y5
----

External commands and G-Code may be mixed on the same button.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = %halshow \ g0x.5y.5 \ %halmeter
----

[[button-probe]]

[underline]*Probe Test*

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = probe-test 30
----

PlasmaC will begin a probe and when the probe is detected, the Z axis will rise to the Pierce Height currently displayed in the Run Panel. It will then wait in this state for the time specified (in this case 30 seconds) then it will return the Z axis to the top.

[[button-ohmic]]

[underline]*Ohmic Test*

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = ohmic-test
----

PlasmaC will enable the Ohmic Probe Enable and if the ohmic probe is sensed, the LED indicator in the monitor panel will light. The main purpose of this is to allow a quick test for a shorted torch tip.

[[button-cut]]

[underline]*Cut Type*

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = cut-type
----

This button if selected will toggle between the two <<cut-types, cut types>>.

[[button-consumables]]

[underline]*Change Consumables*

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = change-consumables X10 Y10 F1000
----

This button moves the torch to the specified coordinates when the machine is paused to allow easy access to change consumables.

Valid entries are Xnnn Ynnn Fnnn. F is mandatory and at least one of X or Y are required.

The X and Y entries are in absolute machine coordinates. If X or Y are missing then the current coordinate for that axis is used.

There are three methods to return to the previous coordinates:

- Press the button again and the torch will return and the machine will wait for a resume command.
- Resume the program which causes the torch to return then the program will begin running.
- Stop the program which causes the torch to return then the program will abort.

[[button-load]]

[underline]*Load*

Buttons 10~19 in the Extras Panel are able to load a GCode program by using the following format.

----
BUTTON_n_CODE = load path/to/gcode.ngc
----

The path is relative to the directory specified by 'PROGRAM_PREFIX' in the .ini file. This is usually ~/linuxcnc/nc_files, so if your gcode file was in a subdirectory of your 'PROGRAM_PREFIX' directory named 'plasma' then the entry would be 'plasma/gcode.ngc'.

=== Button Image

Buttons 10~19 in the Extras Panel are able to display an image by using the following format. If an image is specified then this will take precedence and the image will be displayed rather than the button name.

----
BUTTON_n_IMAGE = path/to/image.png
----

The path is relative to the configuration directory, so if your image was in a subdirectory of your configuration directory named 'images' then the entry would be 'images/image.png'.

All images are displayed in a 60 x 60 format.

[[material-file]]

== Material File

PlasmaC uses a file containing cut parameters for materials. This file is used for <<material-handling, material handling>>.

The file name is derived from '[EMC]MACHINE' in the in file, so a machine named 'METRIC_PLASMAC' would have a material file named 'metric_plasmac_material.cfg'.

The following variables are mandatory and an error message will appear if any are not found when the material file is loaded.

* PIERCE_HEIGHT
* PIERCE_DELAY
* CUT_HEIGHT
* CUT_SPEED

The following variables are optional. If any are not detected or have no value assigned, they will be assigned a value of 0 and no error message will appear.

* NAME
* KERF_WIDTH
* THC
* PUDDLE_JUMP_HEIGHT
* PUDDLE_JUMP_DELAY
* CUT_AMPS
* CUT_VOLTS
* PAUSE_AT_END
* GAS_PRESSURE
* CUT_MODE

WARNING: It is the responsibility of the operator to ensure that the variables are included if they are a requirement for the GCode to be run.

The material file uses the following format:

----
[MATERIAL_NUMBER_1]
NAME                = name
KERF_WIDTH          = value
THC                 = value (0 = off, 1 = on)
PIERCE_HEIGHT       = value
PIERCE_DELAY        = value
PUDDLE_JUMP_HEIGHT  = value
PUDDLE_JUMP_DELAY   = value
CUT_HEIGHT          = value
CUT_SPEED           = value
CUT_AMPS            = value (only used for operator information)
CUT_VOLTS           = value (modes 0 & 1 only, if not using auto voltage sampling)
PAUSE_AT_END        = value
GAS_PRESSURE        = value (only used for Powermax communications)
CUT_MODE            = value (only used for Powermax communications)
----

It is possible to add new material, delete material or edit existing material from the <<run-buttons, Run Panel.>>

It is also possible to edit the material file with a text editor while LinuxCNC is running and then after any changes have been saved, press 'Reload' in the Run Panel to reload the material file.

== Example Configurations

There are example configuration files for both the Axis and Gmoccapy GUIs which use the PlasmaC HAL component to simulate plasma cutting machines.

* metric_plasmac.ini
* imperial_plasmac.ini

If you have copied any example configs to your ~/linuxcnc/configs directory then they are able to be updated by running the Configurator in Upgrade mode. This will replace any copied plasmac system file with a link to the latest version you have upgraded to.

== NGC Samples

There are some sample G-Code files in nc_files/plasmac.

== Test Panel

There is a ./test directory in the source which has a simple Test Panel and associated python file which can be used to test the example configuration as referenced in the .ini file.

If you wish to use this in your own sim configuration then you will need to create a link to this directory and edit your .ini file to suit.

== Upgrade An Existing LinuxCNC Configuration

The method of upgrading is dependent on the type of LinuxCNC installation:

=== Upgrade A LinuxCNC Buildbot Installation

From a terminal:

----
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
----

=== Upgrade A LinuxCNC Run In Place Installation

From a terminal:

----
$ cd ~/linuxcnc-dev
$ git pull
$ cd src
$ make
$ sudo make setuid
----

=== Change Type Of LinuxCNC Installation

It is possible to change the type of LinuxCNC installation:

* If you currently have a working run in place installation and you want to switch to a buildbot installation then do a <<buildbot-install, buildbot installation>>.
* If you currently have a working buildbot installation and you want to switch to a run in place installation then do a <<rip-install, run in place installation>>.

== Upgrade An Existing PlasmaC Configuration

=== Automatic Upgrade

PlasmaC will test if it needs an upgrade each time LinuxCNC is started. If it finds that it needs upgrading it will automatically proceed with the upgrade. After the upgrade is complete LinuxCNC will need to be restarted.

=== Manual Upgrade

If you do not wish to allow PlasmaC to do automatic upgrades then you can prevent this by adding 'MANUAL_UPGRADE = 1' to the [PLASMAC] section of the .ini file:

----
MANUAL_UPGRADE            = 1
----

You would then need to manually upgrade PlasmaC by opening a terminal and running the configurator:

====
$ python linuxcnc/<your_configuration_directory>/configurator.py
====

The selection window is now visible:

image::images/plasmac_configurator_home_used.png[width=300]

Select 'Upgrade' from the selection window, this shows an info dialog, select 'Continue' and the Upgrade window will display.

image::images/plasmac_configurator_upgrade.png[width=400]

Select the .ini file of the PlasmaC configuration you wish to upgrade, click 'Upgrade' and your PlasmaC configuration will be upgraded.

[[modify-config]]

== Reconfigure An Existing PlasmaC Configuration

The Configurator is able to modify:

* The HAL pins connecting PlasmaC to the machine.
* The mode used by PlasmaC.
* The position of the Run Panel in the GUI.

Reconfiguring a Plasmac configuration is done from the Configurator which is located in your configuration directory.

To start the configurator open a terminal and enter:

====
$ python linuxcnc/<your_configuration_directory>/configurator.py
====

The selection window is now visible:

image::images/plasmac_configurator_home_used.png[width=300]

Select 'Reconfigure' from the selection window, this shows an info dialog, select 'Continue' and the Reconfigure window will display.

image::images/plasmac_configurator_reconfigure.png[width=400]

Select the .ini file of the PlasmaC configuration you wish to reconfigure.

If you change modes then you will notice that entry boxes change depending on the currently selected mode.

When all entries are correct, click 'Reconfigure' and your PlasmaC configuration will be reconfigured.

Entry descriptions can be found <<configurator-table, here>>

NOTE: Machine Name and .hal File can not be modified.

== Materialverter

This application is used to convert existing tool tables into PlasmaC material files it can also create a material file from manual user input to entry fields.

At this stage the only conversions available are from SheetCam and Fusion360.

Sheetcam tool tables are complete and the conversion is fully automatic. The SheetCam tool file must be in the SheetCam .tools format.

Fusion360 tool tables do not have all required fields so the user is prompted for missing parameters.  The Fusion360 tool file must be in the Fusion360 .json format.

If you have a format you would like converted, create a 'New Topic' in the https://forum.linuxcnc.org/plasmac[PlasmaC forum] section of the https://forum.linuxcnc.org/[LinuxCNC forum].

Materialverter may be run from a GUI file manager by double clicking on 'materialverter.py' in your configuration directory or may be run from a terminal with the following command:

----
$ python ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine-name>/materialverter.py
----

This will bring up the materialverter dialog:

image::images/plasmac_material_main.png[width=400]

Select one of:

* Manual - to manually create a new material file.
* SheetCam - to convert a SheetCam tool file.
* Fusion360 - to convert a Fusion360 tool file.

For SheetCam only, select whether you would like a metric or imperial output file.

For a conversion, select the Input File you wish to have converted.

Select the Output File you wish to write to, this would normally be ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine-name>_material.cfg, although you could select a different file and hand edit your <machine-name>_material.cfg file.

Click Create/Convert and your new material file will be created.

For a Manual creation or a Fusion360 conversion a dialog will show and any entry marked with pass:[***] is mandatory and all other entries are optional depending on your configuration.

with any required parameters displayed for input.

image::images/plasmac_material_dialogs.png[width=300]

NOTE: If you select ~/linuxcnc/configs/<machine-name>_material.cfg then if this file already exists it will be overwritten.

[[mesa-thcad]]

== Mesa THCAD

The preferred jumper settings are, 'UNIPOLAR' and 'F/32'

You will need to manually add a scale, filter and counter mode to your base machine .hal file before running the Configurator.

If you connected your THCAD to a mesa 7i76e then the commands required in the .hal file would be:

----
setp  hm2_7i76e.0.encoder.00.scale -1
setp  hm2_7i96.0.encoder.00.filter        1
setp  hm2_7i76e.0.encoder.00.counter-mode 1
----

You then need to note that the 'Arc Voltage HAL Pin' entry in the PlasmaC Configurator will be:

----
hm2_7i76e.0.encoder.00.velocity
----

=== Obtaining The Divider Ratio

[underline]*THCAD-10*

If connecting to a plasma CNC port then the divider ratio is selected from the plasma machine.

If connecting to the plasma machines full arc voltage then a common setup is a 1 megOhm resistance from arc negative to THCAD negative and a 1 megOhm resistance from arc positive to THCAD positive. This gives a full scale reading of 210V. The THCAD can handle over-voltages up to 500V so this is not a problem.

To get the divider ratio use (R1 + R2 + 100000) / 100000 so for the above it would be (1000000 + 1000000 + 100000) / 100000 giving a ratio of 21.

IMPORTANT: If you are using a HF start plasma power supply then each of these resistances should be made up of several high voltage resistors.

[underline]*THCAD-300*

This is connected to the plasma machines full arc voltage and the divider ratio = 1

=== Calibration Values

This is to obtain the starting values for Voltage Offset and Voltage Scale in the Config Panel.

If you look at the rear of the THCAD you will see a calibration sticker with:

----
    THCAD-10      |        THCAD-300
                  |
 0V  121.1 kHz    |     0V   121.1 kHz
10V  925.3 kHz    |   300V   925.3 kHz
----

Or similar values, these are the frequencies generated by the THCAD for 0 volts and full scale volts respectively.

You can now calculate the values as shown below or use https://jscalc.io/calc/NTr5QDX6WgMThBVb[this online calulator]

[underline]*Voltage Scale*

Use the formula:

----
Divider_Ratio / ((Full_Scale_Frequency - 0V_Frequency) / Frequency_Divider / Full_Scale_Voltage)
----

This result will be used for setting 'Voltage Scale' in the Config Panel when setting up the configuration.

THCAD-10 example would be:

----
21 / ((925300 - 121100) / 32 / 10) = 0.00835613
----

For our calculation above, we used 21 from our divider calculation, 32 from the jumper setting 'F/32' and 10 which is the full scale reading of the THCAD card itself.

THCAD-300 example would be:

----
1 / ((925300 - 121100) / 32 / 300) = 0.01193732
----

For our calculation above, we used 1 as our divider ratio, 32 from the jumper setting 'F/32' and 300 which is the full scale reading of the THCAD card itself.


[underline]*Voltage Offset*

Use the formula:

----
0V_Frequency / 32
----

This result will be used for setting 'Voltage Offset' in the Config Panel when setting up the configuration.

The THCAD-10 and THCAD-300 examples above would be:

----
121100 / 32 = 3784.375
----

=== Mesa Board Settings

When using a THCAD connected to an encoder on a Mesa Electronics board e.g. 7i96 then it is necessary to set the encoder to up/down mode in the .hal file and it is recommended to set encoder channel B (if it exists) to single ended (TTL) mode by setting jumpers on the board. See your board manual for further information.

Settings in the .hal file would then be similar to:

----
setp    hm2_7i96.0.encoder.00.counter-mode  1
setp    hm2_7i96.0.encoder.00.filter        1
setp    hm2_7i96.0.encoder.00.scale        -1
----

NOTE: There is a <<lowpass, lowpass filter>> available which may be useful if using a THCAD.

== Powermax Communications

Communications can be established with a Hypertherm Powermax plasma cutter that has a RS485 port. This then enables the setting of 'Cut Mode', 'Cutting Amperage' and 'Gas Pressure' automatically from the 'Cut Parameters' of the material file.

If Gas Pressure is set to Zero then the Powermax will calculate the required pressure from the Cut Mode, Cut Current, torch type and torch length.

The maximum and minimum values of these parameters are read from the plasma cutter and the related spin-buttons in the Cut Parameters are set with these values.

This function is enabled by setting the correct port name for the PM_PORT variable in the [PLASMAC] section of the .ini file.

----
[PLASMAC]
PM_PORT = /dev/ttyusb0
PM_PRESSURE_DISPLAY = Bar
----

If you are unsure of the name of your port there is a python script in the configuration directory that will show all available ports and can also be used to test communications with the plasma unit prior to using this feature in PlasmaC. To use the test script enter the following in a terminal.

----
$ python ~/user/linuxcnc/configs/<your_config>/pmx_test.py
----

The gas pressure units display is configured by the PM_PRESSURE_DISPLAY variable. This should be set to the units configured in the Powermax unit being connected to, then the text entered for the PM_PRESSURE_DISPLAY variable is shown next to the Gas Pressure spinbutton on the Run Panel.

If the PM_PORT variable is not set in the .ini file then the widgets associated with this function will not be visible.

The Powermax machine will go into remote mode after communications have been established and will be controlled remotely. The connection can be validated by observing the Powermax display.

To switch the Powermax back to local mode you can either:

.  Disable Powermax Comms from the Run panel
.  Powerdown the Powermax for 30 seconds and then power it back on.
.  Close LinuxCNC which will put the Powermax into local mode during shutdown.

NOTE: To use the Powermax communictions feature it is necessary to have the python pyserial module installed. +
If pyserial is not installed an error message will be displayed.

To install pyserial, type the following in a terminal:

----
sudo apt-get install python-serial
----

It should be noted that during the initial testing phase of this feature it was found that the USB to RS485 converter had reliability issues and that a PCI RS485 card was then installed on the test machine with no issues at all.
