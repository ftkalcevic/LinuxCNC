This directory consists of snippets of gcode that should be accepted.
All files that match the glob '*.ngc' are tested.

An individual file is considered to be a failure if it is rejected by
the interpreter.

If any file is a failure, then the test as a whole fails and will count
as 1 failure in the testsuite.
