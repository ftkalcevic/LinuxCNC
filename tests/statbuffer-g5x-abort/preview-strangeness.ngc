; If machine is in G54, and a program in G55 is aborted during run,
;  preview will display DROs and origin in G55 coords, but mode line
;  will say G54, register #5220 will contain 1, and MDI motion
;  commands will use G54 coords.

; To reproduce:
; - A. Load this program
; - B. Set up coordinate systems with MDI commands:
;    G10 L2 P1 X0 Y0 Z-4 (Set G54)
;    G10 L2 P2 X0 Y0 Z-5 (Set G55)
;    G54 (Use G54)
;    G0 X0 Y0 Z0 (Move to 0,0,0)
; - C. Run program, stopping during execution at 2. below
; - D. Move tool to origin with MDI command:
;    G0 X0 Y0 Z0 (Move to 0,0,0)
; - E. Verify:
;   - a. Mode line:  G54
;   - b. MDI: G0 X0 Y0 Z0 ; Tool moves to abs X0Y0Z-4 == G54 X0Y0Z0
;   - c. MDI: (debug, G53+#5220; Z#5422) ; Prints "G53+1.0 Z0.0" == G54
;   - d. Preview:  DROs say G55 X0Y0Z1; origin position at G55

; 1.  Set a non-G54 offset and move to origin
G55
G0 X0 Y0 Z0

; 2.  Stop program during execution of the following line
G1 X5 Y-5 F1 (Slow move; STOP PROGRAM NOW)

; (This line will never be reached)
M30
