TODO for the joints_axes branch

* clean up joints/axes throughout the whole code (lots of parts already done)
* define a unified jogging way (both for joints and axes)
* implement joint-limits for carthesian moves (requires simulating the speed in userspace)
* update configs
(and many other probably..)

TODO     sort out axis/joints issues: 
	    * limits need to be imposed on joints (tricky with kins)
	    * ini changes 
	    * clean out code (on all different levels, when joints are involved, call them joints..)
    -- this work is taking place on the joints_axes3 branch

TODO     Convert all hardware drivers to use canonical homing, 

Fixes in HAL modules:
TODO     canonical interfaces and naming conventions
