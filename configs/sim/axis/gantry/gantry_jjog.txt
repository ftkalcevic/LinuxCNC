gantry_jjog sim config

o Default configs that synchronize the
  final homing move for multiple joints disallow
  individual jogging of such joints since
  such jogs invite operator error and gantry
  racking.  This more complex config demonstrates:

Individual joint mode jogging for joint1 and joint3

Synchronized joint mode jogging for joint1 and joint3


Example Procedure:

 1) Estop-off  (F1)
 2) Machine-on (F2)
 3) Set halscope to "Roll" and resize
 4) Panel "J1,3 JOGGING": set ENABLE to ON
    to allow jogging for joint1 and joint3
 5) use COUNTS to jog both joint1 and joint3
    SYNCHRONOUSLY in realtim
 6) use axisgui jog number radiobuttons
    and the plus(+) and minus(-) pushbuttons
    to jog any joint INDIVIDUALLY.
    NOTE: this would RACK a two-motor gantry
 7) Panel "J1,3 JOGGING": set ENABLE to OFF
    to allow homing
 8) HOME All (Ctrl-HOME) to home all joints
    (it may be necessary to first move all joints
    close to zero to properly simulate home switches)
 9) Use axisgui X,Y,Z radiobuttons
    and the plus(+) and minus(-) pushbuttons
    to jog any coordinate
10) Return to joint mode using the $ key

Notes:
a) Uses trivkins coordinates=XYZY kinstype=BOTH
b) The "J1,3 JOGGING" panel makes hal connections to
   alter ini.[13].home_sequence and motion.homing-inhibit
   settings to allow jogging of joints that use synchronized
   homing provisions.
c) The "J1,3 JOGGING" COUNTS widget simulates
   the counts which would normally be supplied
   by an Manual-Pulse-Generator (MPG or wheel jog).
d) The "J1,3 JOGGING" SCALE widget sets the distance
   in machine units for each count
e) In joint mode, the axis gui displays joint numbers
   and joint positions correctly but the graphical
   interpretation may be misleading.
