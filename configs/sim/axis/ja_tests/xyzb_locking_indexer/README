The TEMPORARY xyzb directory contains standalone, simplified xyzb ini examples
to test:

  a) wheel jogging for IDENTITY kins configs where the hal pins
     for joints and axes jogging  are connected together
  b) omitted axis letters
  c) duplicated axis letters (ref: some gantry configs do this)
  d) locking indexer on AXIS_B (the joint number depends on the configuration
  e) automatically set mode to teleop after homing

The configs start additional applications:
 1) sim_pin gui to demonstrate wheel jogging for joints and axes
     Signal j:x is jog-counts for  axis x AND joint 0
     Signal j:y is jog-counts for  axis y AND joint 1
     Signal j:z is jog-counts for  axis z AND joint 2
     Signal j:b is jog-counts for  axis b AND joint 3
 2) halshow app to show relevant hal pins

xyzb.ini   trivkins with ommitted axis letter (a)
xyyzb.ini  trivkins with ommitted axis letter (a)
                                   and  duplicated axis letter (y)
                                   and  auto teleop after homing

The xyyzb.ini uses the trivkins kinstype option
to set the kinematics type to KINEMATICS_BOTH to demonstrate
jogging and teleop jogging.
