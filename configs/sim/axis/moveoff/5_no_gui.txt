moveoff no_gui

This demonstration provides no gui support but pops up several general-purpose utilities to show behavior for a single axis (2 => z).

The sim_pin utility is used to set pin values that would normally be connected to a gui or set to fixed values according to inifile settings:

The utility sim_pin is used to set pins to control the component.

A halshow application widget shows a watch panel for pins associated with the z-axis offset.  See the file moveoff.hal for connections.

A halscope session is started (select 'Roll' to start) to show behavior of important moveoff inputs and outputs

These utilties can be augmented or disabled using the inifile settings:
 [APPLICATIONS]APP = program_name

Note: This is a Hal-only implementation and the offset positions are NOT shown on the axis gui preview.
