corexy examples:

corexy_by_kins.ini 
  Demonstrates corexykins kinematics
  (Note: using corexykins kinematics
   on real hardware requires home
   switches triggered by motor
   positions)

corexy_by_hal.ini
  Demonstrates use of trivkins with
  corexy kinematics implemented by a
  hal component
  (Notes: this method supports
  home switches aligned with x,y
  coordinates)

Notes:
 1) The configurations share common ini
    file settings from corey_base.inc
 2) Home switches are simulated
 3) stepgens are configured but no
    connections to hardware are 
    included.
